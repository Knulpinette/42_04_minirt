My first raytracer in C.

* run `git clone git@github.com:Knulpinette/42_04_minirt.git`
* run `make`
* run `./minirt scenes/ANY_SCENE` (it might take a few seconds to generate the image)

## MiniRT üòà VS Cub3D üëæüïπÔ∏è

If you're from 42 and ended up on this project, chances are you're wondering if you should take on this project or go to his most liked, easier counterpart: cub3D. In the end, it all comes down to what your priorities are - both projects are cool and will teach you a lot.

Here are a few thougts:
- You will be able to do cub3D if you do miniRT, the opposite isn't so true. 
- The investement of time and effort will be bigger with miniRT than with cub3D, but so will the takeaways.
- MiniRT gave me the confidence I can debug anything if I just don't give up - I don't know if that will turn out to be true, but it's one of the most valuable lessons I've been taught by a 42 project so far. 
- It also was the first big project I did on my own (I did miniRT before the change in curriculum) and it taught me a lot on how to write modular code.
- Because the documentation is sparse on how to do your own raytracer in C, it also taught me better how to deal with lack of documentation which is a very real life case scenario. I contacted people who did the project from other schools, I also went for documentations in other langages (speaking or coding) that I often didn't even understand. 
- You will never, <i>ever</i>, look at a animation movie or CGI the same way. 

In the end, if you have time and want to learn more or want to work in animation or graphics, go for miniRT. If you want to work in games or if the blackhole is looming on the horizon, go for cub3D. 

## The Starter Kit

### The Maths Conundrum üìêüìâ

When you haven't done math for 10 years, diving into miniRT as a refresher project is brutal. It is however not impossible - and really cool to realise you would have loved maths if you had realised all the amazing things it could be used for when you were young.
